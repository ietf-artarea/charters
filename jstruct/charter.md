A schema language for a data interchange format specifies the allowable content of a document using that format.
Examples of such schema languages are XML Schema for XML and CDDL for CBOR. The IETF has specified JSON in
[RFC 8259](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259) but has yet to specify a schema language for JSON.
Several Internet Drafts for "JSON Schema" are often cited, but these documents do not have IETF consensus.

The goal of this working group is to provide a stable reference, as Informational, for citations to "JSON Schema"
and to provide a successor schema language, JSON Structure, as a Proposed Standard.

This working group will produce an Informational RFC for JSON Schema based on
[draft-bhutton-json-schema-01](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bhutton-json-schema/). This working
group will consider the current implementations and deployments of JSON Schema in an attempt
to make as few non-breaking changes as possible. However, updates to the Security Considerations
are expected and in scope of this group's work.

After completing the work item above, this working group will create a successor schema language,
JSON Structure, as a Proposed Standard. The starting point for this work will be based on the following
documents:

* [draft-vasters-json-structure-core](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vasters-json-structure-core/)
* [draft-vasters-json-structure-import](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vasters-json-structure-import/)
* [draft-vasters-json-structure-units](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vasters-json-structure-units/)
* [draft-vasters-json-structure-validation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vasters-json-structure-validation)
* [draft-vasters-json-structure-cond-composition](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vasters-json-structure-cond-composition/)
* [draft-vasters-json-structure-alternate-names](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vasters-json-structure-alternate-names/)
