# Introduction & Background

This section should introduce the subject of the working group.
Additionally, it may state the motivations of the working group
and/or the desired high-level outcome from the working group.

# Scope

This section describes the scope of the working group. It should
list any input documents, such as I-Ds, that the working group will
consider as a starting point for its work.

It is just as important to list what is out-of-scope for the working
group. If related technologies exist that are out-of-scope for the
working group, describe them.


# Deliverables

Describe the work items to be delivered by the working group, which
are usually I-Ds. However, consider the
[IESG Statement on Supporting Documents](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/statement-iesg-support-documents-in-ietf-working-groups-20230824/).  
That is, not all working groups need their requirements published as an RFC.
Some working groups do not need requirements and some need agreed upon
motivations instead of requirements.

For I-Ds to be delivered to the IESG for publication, specify their
category (i.e. standards track, informational).

And for each work item, attempt to give an estimate of delivery.
