The Domain Connect Working Group (WG) is chartered to develop and standardize the [Domain Connect Protocol](https://www.domainconnect.org/).

Domain Connect is an application-level protocol that enables Service Providers to request configuration of required DNS records in their customers’ zones in order to integrate their products. 
The protocol has notable adoption among both DNS and Service Providers.

The Working Group acknowledges that Domain Connect is "a deployed technology for which protecting the installed base is essential, including retention of core interoperability," as described in Section 4 of RFC 7221. 
Accordingly, the WG will prioritize stability and backward compatibility, and will avoid changes that could break existing implementations or deployments.
The working group may make breaking changes to address critical security issues.

The WG will use [draft-kowalik-domainconnect](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kowalik-domainconnect/) as the starting point for its work. 

The scope of the WG’s activities includes:
* Ensuring that the specification is precise and provides clear guidance for implementers.
* Addressing any ambiguities, inconsistencies, or issues identified within the current draft.
* Producing a comprehensive document suitable for publication as a Standards Track RFC.

The WG will coordinate with the OAUTH working group to ensure the security considerations of the Domain Connect Protocol are well-defined.

The WG is not chartered to develop functional extensions, new features, or additional use cases for the Domain Connect Protocol. 
If such needs arise during the course of the WG's work, rechartering will be required.

### Deliverables

* A Standards Track document(s) specifying the Domain Connect Protocol.
