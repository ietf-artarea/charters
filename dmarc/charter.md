DMARC was previously chartered to develop and publish a base document and two reporting documents.
This work has been completed.

In the intervening time, the working group also published the Authenticated Received Chain protocol
as experimental RFC 8617.  Industry experience has shown that this proposal has enjoyed neither
noteworthy uptake nor sufficient impact, though it continues to develop momentum that is believed
to be unsupportable by evidence.

Accordingly, DMARC is being rechartered to publish a document that moves RFC 8617 to
historical/obsolete status, including prose describing the history and current status of the work.

This iteration of the DMARC working group is chartered for the sole purpose of completing this task,
sending it to the IESG for publication as an Informational item. This working group will adopt
no other documents or work items.  This sole task is to be completed no later than six months
from working group rechartering. If this working group fails to meet this deadline, the group
will close at that time, and the community may seek alternate avenues for support such as from
an Area Director or the Independent Submissions stream, or abandon the work altogether.
