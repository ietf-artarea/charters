The Registration Protocols Extensions working group (REGEXT) is chartered to coordinate and standardize extensions to the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) and the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP).

The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP, STD 69) is the standard application-layer client-server protocol for the provisioning and management of objects stored in a shared central repository.

The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP, STD 95) is the standard for retrieving registration data and metadata from both Domain Name Registries (DNRs) and Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). 

The working group may publish proposed standard and experimental extensions to EPP and RDAP.
The working group may publish informational and best current practice documents for EPP and RDAP.
The working group may revise the registration procedures for the EPP and RDAP registries.
The working group will discuss new registrations with the designated experts for the EPP and RDAP registries.
When the working group is closed, the mailing list will remain open and available for the use of the expert review process.

A primary goal of the working group is to ensure the extensions are easily discoverable and understood, and to avoid duplicate effort that could harm interoperability.

In addition to publishing extensions, the working group may publish proposed standards addressing interoperability issues that are adjacent to EPP and RDAP.

For example:

* Data formats for exchanges between registration entities that need insertion or extraction using EPP, or extraction using RDAP.

*  The specification of application transport protocols for EPP based on existing RFCs, with proper review and advice from the relevant protocol working groups.

The working group does not have fixed deliverables, as it is a maintenance group that publishes extensions as they are needed by the RDAP and EPP communities.
